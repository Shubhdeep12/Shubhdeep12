### __I’m a software engineer and open-source developer/maintainer/enthusiast based in India.__

This is my journey with open source so far:

```
<2020         →  I used to think GitHub was just a place where people stored their personal projects.

2020 - 2021   →  Discovered that people and companies also create packages to help the community.
                 Learned about the rich text editor Quill for the first time (as far as I remember).

2021 - 2023   →  Realized companies open-source their code too. Thought, "How on earth will I understand this?"
                 Gave it a shot. Sometimes I failed, but other times I understood the code pretty well.

>=2024        →  Every repo is a learning opportunity – whether it’s an SDK, a component library,
                 or a full end-to-end product. Let’s dive in and get involved 😎
```


As part of my open-source work, I usually work on:

- [getsentry/spotlight](https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight) 
- [shubhdeepchhabra.in](https://github.com/Shubhdeep12/shubhdeepchhabra.in)

I love diving into projects that catch my curiosity — here are a few👇

- [antiwork/helper](https://github.com/antiwork/helper)
- [formbricks/formbricks](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks)
